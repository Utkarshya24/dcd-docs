title: DDoS Protection & API Rate Limits
description: How dcdeploy protects workloads with Cloudflare DDoS mitigation and enforced API rate limiting.
---

dcdeploy ensures that your applications stay online and secure under heavy traffic and potential attacks.  
This is achieved through **Cloudflare’s global edge network** for DDoS mitigation and **default API rate limiting** to prevent abuse.

---

## Cloudflare DDoS Protection

- All incoming traffic to dcdeploy workloads is routed through **Cloudflare’s edge network**.  
- Protects against:
  - **Layer 3/4 attacks** (volumetric floods, SYN floods, UDP floods).  
  - **Layer 7 attacks** (HTTP floods, slowloris).  
- Uses **intelligent traffic filtering** to allow legitimate users while blocking malicious requests.  
- Provides **global anycast routing** for high availability and performance.  

**Benefits**
- Automatic mitigation of large-scale DDoS attacks.  
- Zero downtime during attacks.  
- Faster response due to Cloudflare’s **120+ edge locations worldwide**.

## Default API Rate Limits

To protect workloads from abuse and accidental overload, dcdeploy enforces **default request-per-second (RPS) limits**.

### Per-Service Defaults
- **Burst traffic allowed** (short spikes are absorbed).  
- Sustained limits are applied per service instance.  
- Requests beyond the threshold return:  
  ```http
  429 Too Many Requests
  ```
Example
```yaml
services:
  my-app:
    type: service
    ports:
      - 443
    protocol: https
    limits:
      rps: 100   # default applied per instance
```

### Use Cases
- Protection against brute force attacks – prevents credential stuffing or API abuse.
- Fair usage enforcement – ensures no single client can overload your workloads.
- Cost control – keeps autoscaling predictable and avoids unnecessary overprovisioning.

### Best Practices
- Use authentication + rate limiting in your app for per-user control.
- Configure autoscaling by RPS if you expect sudden traffic surges.
- Monitor logs for repeated 429 Too Many Requests errors.
- For enterprise workloads, request custom rate limits via support.
