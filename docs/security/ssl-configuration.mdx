title: SSL Configuration
description: Configure and manage SSL/TLS certificates for your applications and services in DCDeploy for secure HTTPS traffic.
---

DCDeploy automatically provisions and manages **SSL/TLS certificates** for your applications, ensuring all traffic is served securely over **HTTPS**.  
You can use SSL with both **default `.cloud` domains** and **custom domains**.

---

## Overview

- **Automatic SSL** – Free SSL certificates issued via Let’s Encrypt.  
- **Supported domains** – Works with DCDeploy’s default `.cloud` domains and your custom domains.  
- **Auto-renewal** – Certificates are renewed automatically before expiry.  
- **Zero-downtime updates** – Certificates refresh without interrupting traffic.  

---

## Use Cases

- Secure your **web apps** and **APIs** with HTTPS.  
- Enforce **end-to-end encryption** for sensitive workloads.  
- Deploy custom domains with **trusted certificates**.  

---

## SSL on Default Domains

All workloads deployed with a `.cloud` domain (e.g., `myapp.DCDeploy.cloud`) automatically get SSL enabled.  
You don’t need to configure anything.

Example:  
```bash
https://myapp.DCDeploy.cloud
```
## SSL on Custom Domains
When using a custom domain, DCDeploy provisions and manages SSL certificates automatically after you point DNS to the platform.

### Steps:
1. Add your custom domain in the DCDeploy dashboard.
2. Update your DNS records to point to the provided target (CNAME or A record).
3. Wait for validation.
4. SSL certificate is issued and HTTPS is enabled automatically.

## Enforcing HTTPS
By default, SSL is enabled, but you may also enforce strict HTTPS redirection:

```yaml
services:
  my-app:
    domains:
      - name: myapp.com
        forceSSL: true
```        
This ensures all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.

## Example: Multi-Domain SSL
```yaml
services:
  my-api:
    domains:
      - name: myapi.com
        forceSSL: true
      - name: api.mycompany.com
```      
Both domains will have SSL certificates provisioned and managed automatically.

## Troubleshooting
- SSL not active?
  - Check if your DNS is pointing correctly to DCDeploy.
  - Verify DNS propagation (can take a few minutes).
- Certificate pending?
  - Ensure there are no conflicting DNS records (e.g., another A record or CNAME).
- Expired certificate?
  - Certificates are auto-renewed. If still expired, check logs and contact support.

## Best Practices
- Always enable forceSSL for production workloads.
- Use custom domains with SSL for customer-facing apps.
- Avoid exposing workloads without SSL unless strictly necessary.
- Combine SSL with private networking for internal-only services.
