description: How DCDeploy ensures workload and data security using Cilium, Kata Containers, encryption at rest, secrets management, and isolation.
---

DCDeploy is designed with **security as a core principle**, ensuring that applications and data are protected at every layer.  
From the **network plane** to the **container runtime**, DCDeploy applies modern security practices for safe multi-tenant operations.

## Security Layers

### 1. Network Security with Cilium
- DCDeploy uses **Cilium (eBPF-based networking)** for workload communication.  
- Provides **identity-aware network policies** instead of relying only on IPs.  
- Enforces **zero-trust networking** between services and environments.  
- Prevents lateral movement by restricting unauthorized connections.  

Example policy:
```yaml
apiVersion: cilium.io/v2
kind: CiliumNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-access
spec:
  endpointSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-service
  egress:
  - toEndpoints:
    - matchLabels:
        app: my-db
```        
### 2. Workload Isolation with Kata Containers
- Containers run inside lightweight VMs using Kata Containers.
- Provides hardware-enforced isolation between tenants.
- Limits the blast radius in case of container escape exploits.
- Delivers the speed of containers with the security boundary of VMs.

### 3. Data Security â€“ Encryption at Rest
- All persistent volumes and databases use AES-256 encryption at rest.
- Keys are managed and rotated automatically by the platform.
- Ensures compliance with security standards (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2).
- Even if disks are compromised, data remains unreadable.

### 4. Secrets Management
- Secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) are stored in encrypted secret stores.
- Mounted into workloads only at runtime.
- Never exposed in build logs, environment dumps, or plaintext configs.
- Access is scoped to specific environments and services.

Example in DCDeploy.yml:

```yaml
services:
  my-app:
    env:
      - name: DB_PASSWORD
        valueFromSecret: db_password
```

### 5. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- Each workload is isolated by namespace, network, and VM boundaries.
- Shared resources (CPU, memory, disk) are carefully quota-controlled.
- Prevents noisy neighbors or malicious workloads from impacting others.

## Best Practices for Developers
- Always store sensitive data in Secrets, not plain env variables.
- Use private networking for internal service-to-service communication.
- Regularly rotate database and API credentials.
- Enable health checks to avoid cascading failures from unhealthy services.
