title: Private Network
description: Understand how DCDeploy provides private networking across environments and namespaces for secure service-to-service communication.
---

DCDeploy provides a **built-in private network** for all workloads.  
This allows services to securely communicate with each other **inside the same namespace or environment** without exposing them to the public internet.

---

## Overview

- Every **environment (env)** in DCDeploy has its own **isolated private network**.  
- Services inside the same environment can reach each other using **internal DNS names**.  
- Traffic inside the private network:
  - Never leaves DCDeploy’s infrastructure.  
  - Is protected with **encryption-in-transit**.  
  - Avoids public exposure unless explicitly configured.  

---

## Namespaces & Isolation

- Each **namespace (per environment)** acts as a separate private network.  
- Services in different namespaces cannot talk to each other unless connected via a **private link**.  
- Example:
  - `service-a` in `staging` cannot reach `service-b` in `production` unless explicitly linked.  

---

## Example: Internal Communication

You can call one service from another using its **service name + namespace**.

```bash
curl http://my-api.staging.svc.cluster.local:3000/health
```
- my-api → service name
- staging → namespace (environment)
- .svc.cluster.local → private network domain suffix

## Use Cases
- Connect a backend API to a database without public exposure.
- Secure microservice-to-microservice communication inside the same environment.
- Run internal-only workloads (admin panels, monitoring agents).

## Public vs Private
| Network Type | Accessible From | Use Case                                  |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Public**   | Internet        | Exposing APIs, websites, external clients |
| **Private**  | Internal only   | Databases, internal APIs, secure services |


## Best Practices
- Use private network for all databases and sensitive services.
- Only expose public endpoints when necessary.
- Combine with TCP Proxy for secure DB access if needed externally.
- Use private services + internal links to connect across environments.
