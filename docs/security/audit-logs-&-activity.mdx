DCDeploy provides **audit logs** to help you monitor, trace, and secure activity across your organization.  
Every significant action â€” from deployments to user management â€” is recorded with timestamps, user details, and context.

## Overview

- **Who did what, when, and where** â€“ every action is traceable.  
- Logs include **user identity, action type, resource affected, and timestamp**.  
- Useful for **security investigations, compliance, and debugging issues**.
