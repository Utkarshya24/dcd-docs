title: Audit Logs & Activity
description: Track all actions across your DCDeploy organization with detailed audit logs and activity history.
---

DCDeploy provides **audit logs** to help you monitor, trace, and secure activity across your organization.  
Every significant action — from deployments to user management — is recorded with timestamps, user details, and context.

---

## Overview

- **Who did what, when, and where** – every action is traceable.  
- Logs include **user identity, action type, resource affected, and timestamp**.  
- Useful for **security investigations, compliance, and debugging issues**.
