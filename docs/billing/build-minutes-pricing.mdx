title: Build Minutes Pricing
description: Learn how dcdeploy calculates and charges for build minutes. Currently, all build minutes are unlimited and free of cost.
---

## Overview

When you push code to your repository or trigger a **Rebuild & Deploy**, dcdeploy performs a **build process** to generate the Docker image for your service.  
This process consumes **build minutes** — the total time taken by dcdeploy’s infrastructure to compile, package, and prepare your application image.

---

## Current Pricing

-  **Unlimited build minutes** for all plans.  
-  **No extra charges** are applied for builds.  
-  Every build runs on high-performance infrastructure without time restrictions.  

This means you can push commits, trigger builds, and redeploy as many times as needed **without worrying about build minute limits**.

---

## Future Updates

While build minutes are currently unlimited, dcdeploy may introduce:

- **Plan-based limits** (e.g., Free tier with capped minutes, Pro with higher or unlimited).  
- **Additional usage-based pricing** for extremely heavy workloads.  
- **Build caching optimizations** to reduce build time and costs.  

> ⚠️ If dcdeploy introduces build minute quotas in the future, you’ll be notified in advance and can review the updated pricing at [dcdeploy.com/pricing](https://dcdeploy.com/pricing).

## Best Practices

Even though build minutes are unlimited, it’s good to:

-  Use **Docker layer caching** to speed up builds.  
-  Keep your **Dockerfile optimized** to reduce build time.  
-  Use **multi-stage builds** for smaller and faster images.  
-  Avoid unnecessary rebuilds by using **Redeploy** when only code/config changes.
