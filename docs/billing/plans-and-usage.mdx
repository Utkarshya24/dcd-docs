## Usage

The **Usage and Billing** page provides detailed insights into your monthly spend and environment-wise breakdown.  

### Daily Usage

- A graph displays the **amount spent in the last 30 days**.  
- Each bar represents daily spend in INR (â‚¹).  
- Helps track spending patterns and detect unusual spikes.  

### Usage by Environments

- Shows total usage for the **current billing month**.  
- Breakdown by **environments** (e.g., `env1`, `private-repo`, `public-repo`, `db`).  
- Ensures you know exactly which workloads are driving costs.  

Example:

| Environment   | Monthly Usage (â‚¹) |
|---------------|--------------------|
| env1          | 1,779.61           |
| private-repo  | 136.89             |
| public-repo   | 9,048.18           |
| db            | 576.41             |

### Usage by Machine Type

(If enabled in your project) dcdeploy also provides usage per machine type:  

- **vCPU hours** â€“ cost per compute unit used.  
- **Memory usage** â€“ cost per GB-hour.  
- **Storage usage** â€“ persistent disk or volume charges.  
- **Bandwidth** â€“ outbound data transfer charges.  

This helps in identifying which workloads consume the most resources.

## Billing Information

- Add your **Name, Email, Address, City, Postal Code, and Country**.  
- Option to mark as **Business** for GST/compliance invoices.  
- Saved billing details appear on your monthly invoices.  

---

## Best Practices

-  Review usage trends weekly to avoid billing surprises.  
-  Use environment-wise breakdown to optimize workloads.  
-  Check machine type usage to downsize underutilized resources.  
-  Keep billing info updated for correct invoicing.
