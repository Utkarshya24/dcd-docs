title: Outgoing Bandwidth
description: Understand how outgoing bandwidth usage is measured and managed in DCDeploy. Each organization gets 1TB of free outgoing bandwidth per month.
---

## Overview
Outgoing bandwidth refers to the amount of data transferred **from DCDeploy workloads to the public internet**.  
Every organization on DCDeploy gets **1TB of free outgoing bandwidth per month**. After this limit, additional usage may incur charges.

---

## Use Cases
- Hosting APIs or web apps accessed by external clients.  
- Serving static files, media, or downloads to users.  
- Handling traffic spikes from public-facing services.  

---

## Bandwidth Allocation
- **1TB per month** included free per organization.  
- Applies across **all environments, workloads, and services** under the org.  
- Ingress (incoming traffic to workloads) is **not charged**.  

---

## Monitoring Bandwidth Usage
You can track outgoing bandwidth from the **DCDeploy dashboard**:

1. Go to **Settings → Usage & Billing**.  
2. Check the **Daily Usage** chart for data transfer costs.  
3. View **Usage by Environment** to see which workloads consume the most bandwidth.  

Example (UI):  
- env1 → 600GB  
- api-service → 200GB  
- file-storage → 150GB  
- db → negligible  

---

## Best Practices
- Use a **CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)** to reduce direct bandwidth usage.  
- Compress responses with **gzip** or **brotli** to reduce data size.  
- Cache frequently accessed assets to avoid repeated transfers.  
- Monitor usage regularly to avoid hitting limits.  

---

## Troubleshooting
- **High unexpected bandwidth usage**  
  - Check logs for unusually large file downloads.  
  - Ensure you’re not accidentally exposing large public endpoints.  

- **Service throttled after exceeding limit**  
  - Review your billing plan for overage charges.  
  - Optimize traffic using caching/CDN.
