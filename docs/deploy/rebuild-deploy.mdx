title: Rebuild & Deploy
description: The **Rebuild & Deploy** feature in DCDeploy forces a fresh build of your service and then redeploys it. This is different from a normal **Redeploy**, which may reuse the latest built image. With **Rebuild & Deploy**, the entire Docker image is rebuilt from scratch and then rolled out.
---

## When to use Rebuild & Deploy

- **Dockerfile changes** – When you’ve updated the `Dockerfile` or build context.  
-  **Dependencies update** – If you changed `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or other dependency files.  
-  **Build configuration changes** – Updating `context`, `dockerfilePath`, or `autoBuild` in `DCDeploy.yml`.  
-  **Corrupted image fixes** – Forcing a clean rebuild ensures the latest state is deployed.  


## How Rebuild & Deploy Works

1. **Fresh Build**  
   - DCDeploy ignores cached layers.  
   - A new Docker image is built from your repository or build context.  

2. **Deploy Rollout**  
   - The new image is deployed to your service.  
   - If **zero downtime deployment** is enabled, old containers are kept alive until the new ones pass health checks.  


## Rebuild & Deploy via Dashboard

1. Open the **DCDeploy dashboard**.  
2. Navigate to your service.  
3. Click **Rebuild & Deploy**.  
4. Confirm the rebuild trigger.  
5. Watch build and deployment logs in real-time.  


## Rebuild & Deploy via CLI

```bash
dcd rebuild-deploy <service-name>
```

Example:

```bash
dcd rebuild-deploy my-app
```

This will trigger a fresh build and then deploy the updated image for my-app.


### Auto Rebuild on Commit

If you set `autoBuild:` true in your DCDeploy.yml, DCDeploy automatically triggers a Rebuild & Deploy whenever you push new commits to the specified branch.

Example:

```yaml
services:
  my-app:
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
      repo: my-org/my-repo
      ref: main
      refType: branch
      autoBuild: true
```

- Every commit to main will rebuild and deploy the service automatically.
- Ensures your production always runs the latest code.
- Works with both public and private repositories.


### Key Difference: Redeploy vs Rebuild & Deploy
| Feature            | Redeploy                   | Rebuild & Deploy                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Uses cached image? | Yes                        | No (fresh build)                 |
| Speed             | Faster                     | Slower (full build)              |
| Use case          | Code/config changes only   | Dockerfile/dependencies/build changes |


### Best Practices
- Use Redeploy for small code/config changes.
- Use Rebuild & Deploy when build environment changes are required.
- Test in staging before running on production.
- Enable zero downtime to avoid interruptions during rebuilds.
- Prefer autoBuild: true for continuous integration workflows.

By using Rebuild & Deploy, you ensure your service always runs on the freshest possible build, eliminating risks from outdated or cached images.
