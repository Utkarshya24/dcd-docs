title: Health Checks
description: Health checks in DCDeploy ensure that your workloads are **running correctly** and can handle traffic reliably. By defining health checks, you can detect and recover from failures automatically.

## Types of health checks

### 1. Liveness Probe
- Ensures the container is still running.  
- If the liveness check fails, DCDeploy automatically **restarts the container**.  
- Prevents workloads from staying stuck in an unhealthy state.  

```yaml
health:
  liveness:
    path: /healthz
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 3
```
### 2. Readiness Probe
- Ensures the workload is ready to accept traffic.
- If the readiness check fails, DCDeploy temporarily removes the instance from the load balancer.
- Useful for apps that need some startup time before serving requests.

```yaml
health:
  readiness:
    path: /ready
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 3s
    retries: 5
```

### Benefits
- High availability – Only healthy instances serve requests.
- Automatic recovery – Unhealthy containers are restarted automatically.
- Reduced downtime – Prevents routing to failing workloads.

### Best practices
- Use /healthz or /status endpoints that return a simple 200 OK.
- Ensure your readiness check only passes after dependencies (DB, cache, APIs) are ready.
- Keep health checks lightweight to avoid adding load on your service.

By setting up Health Checks, you ensure that DCDeploy maintains reliable, self-healing workloads that can scale confidently under traffic.
