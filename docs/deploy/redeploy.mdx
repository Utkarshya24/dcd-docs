title: Redeploy
description: The **Redeploy** feature in DCDeploy allows you to quickly apply changes to an existing service without creating a new one. This is useful when you’ve updated your code, modified environment variables, or adjusted configuration and want to roll out the changes seamlessly.

---

## When to use Redeploy

- **Code Updates** – Push new commits to your repo and redeploy to reflect changes.  
- **Environment Variables** – Apply updated secrets or configuration.  
- **Scaling or Workload Types** – Redeploy after adjusting machine type, scaling rules, or workloads.  
- **Hotfixes** – Quickly fix production issues by redeploying a stable build.  


## How Redeploy Works

1. **Detect changes**  
   - DCDeploy checks for updates in your **Git repository** or **container image**.  
   - You can also trigger redeploy manually from the dashboard or CLI.  

2. **Build & Deploy**  
   - A new image is built (if build settings are configured).  
   - The updated version is rolled out to your service.  

3. **Zero Downtime** (if enabled)  
   - DCDeploy performs a rolling update.  
   - Old containers are stopped only after new containers are healthy.  

## Redeploy via Dashboard

1. Navigate to your service in the **environment dashboard**.  
2. Click **Redeploy**.  
3. Select the redeploy source:
   - Latest Git commit  
   - Latest Docker image  
   - Manual trigger  
4. Monitor logs in real-time as the service updates.  

### Best Practices
- Commit and push changes to your repo before redeploying.
- Use redeploy for small-to-medium updates. For major changes, consider creating a new service.
- Test redeployments in staging before applying to production.
- Use health checks to ensure only healthy containers serve traffic during redeploy.

By using Redeploy, you can roll out changes faster, keep services up-to-date, and ensure minimal downtime for your workloads.
