title: DCDeploy Button
description: The **DCDeploy Button** allows you to share ready-to-deploy projects with a single click. It’s designed for **open-source maintainers, educators, and teams** who want others to quickly launch a project on **dcdeploy** without manual setup.
---

---

## How it works

- You add a **DCDeploy Button** to your project’s README or docs.  
- The button links to dcdeploy with your **repository URL** pre-filled.  
- When users click it, dcdeploy automatically:
  - Forks/clones the repo  
  - Reads the `dcdeploy.yml` (deployment config)  
  - Launches the services in the cloud  

---

## Markdown Example

Add this to your **GitHub README.md**:

```markdown
[![Deploy with DCDeploy](https://dcdeploy.com/button.svg)](https://dcdeploy.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/username/project)
```
This will render a button:

### Example: Node.js Project
If your repository has this dcdeploy.yml:

```yaml
services:
  app:
    type: service
    machineType: DCD-1
    regions: India
    image: node:20
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: npm start
    ports:
      - 3000
    protocol: http
    minScale: 1
    maxScale: 5
```    
Then anyone clicking your button will get a fully deployed Node.js app with scaling, health checks, and logs included.

### Benefits
- Instant Deployment – Launch apps with zero setup.
- Developer Friendly – Great for hackathons, demos, and onboarding.
- Open Source Ready – Helps contributors test your project in their own environment.
- One-Click Cloud – No manual config, works straight from GitHub.

### Best Practices
- Always include a dcdeploy.yml in your repo.
- Use environment variables for secrets instead of hardcoding.
- Provide a README section explaining how the button works.
- Test your project by clicking your own button before sharing.

By adding the DCDeploy Button to your repositories, you make it effortless for anyone to clone, deploy, and scale your projects in the cloud.
