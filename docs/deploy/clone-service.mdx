title: Clone Service
description: DCDeploy allows you to **clone an existing service** with a single click. This is useful when you want to create a new workload with the **same configuration** (build settings, ports, scaling rules, environment variables) as an existing one.
---

---

## When to use Clone
- **Staging and Production** → Duplicate your service and point it to a different branch or database.
- **A/B Testing** → Run two versions of the same service with small differences.
- **Quick Setup** → Save time instead of re-entering build and scaling options manually.

---

## How to clone a service

1. Go to your **Environment Dashboard** → **Deploy tab**.  
2. Select the service you want to clone (e.g., `bunny`).  
3. At the bottom of the service card, click **Clone**.  
4. A new service (`bunny-clone`) will be created with identical configuration.  
5. Update the cloned service:
   - Change **name** to avoid conflicts.  
   - Adjust **repository ref / branch / commit** if needed.  
   - Modify **ports** if both services must run simultaneously.  
   - Update **environment variables** (e.g., different API keys).

## Example: Cloning `bunny`

Original service:

```yaml
bunny:
  type: service
  machineType: DCD-1
  regions: India
  build:
    context: ./server1
    dockerfilePath: ./server1/Dockerfile
    repo: Utkarshya24/file-upload-backend
    ref: main
    refType: branch
    commitHash: bb4c2ba325d35e7860f45bf09d9ad61ca04ba3ce
    autoBuild: true
    private: true
  ports:
    - 3001
  minScale: 1
  maxScale: 2
  protocol: https
```

Cloned service:

```yaml
bunny-clone:
  type: service
  machineType: DCD-1
  regions: India
  build:
    context: ./server2
    dockerfilePath: ./server2/Dockerfile
    repo: Utkarshya24/file-upload-backend
    ref: main
    refType: branch
    commitHash: bb4c2ba325d35e7860f45bf09d9ad61ca04ba3ce
    autoBuild: true
    private: true
  ports:
    - 3002
  minScale: 1
  maxScale: 1
  protocol: https
```

## Best practices
- **Rename immediately** to avoid name conflicts.  
- **Use different ports** if both services run in the same environment.  
- **Keep configs in sync** with environment variables or secrets manager.  
- **Use cloning for speed**, but review each setting before deployment.
