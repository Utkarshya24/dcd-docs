title: Secrets
---
The **Secrets** tab allows you to securely store and manage sensitive information,  
such as container registry credentials, API keys, and other environment secrets.  

Secrets are encrypted and only accessible to workloads that you explicitly configure.

---

## Add a Registry

1. Go to the **Secrets** tab.  
2. Click **+ Registry**.  
3. Enter the following details:
   - **Registry** → The registry hostname (e.g., `docker.io`).  
   - **Name** → Unique DCDeploy secrets name .  
   - **Username** → Your registry username.  
   - **Password / Token** → Your registry password or access token.  
4. Save the secret.

## Managing Secrets

- Secrets are stored securely and injected only when required.  
- You can update credentials anytime.  
- Use the delete (trash) icon to remove a secret.

## Usage in Deployments

When deploying workloads, you can select a stored secret for authentication.  
This is commonly required when pulling private images from Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or other private registries.

## Best Practices

- Use **tokens** instead of passwords wherever possible.  
- Rotate secrets regularly to maintain security.  
- Grant secrets access only to workloads that need them.
