title: Scale to Zero
description: Scale to Zero allows your workloads to automatically shut down when they are idle, reducing costs by only running when requests are actively being served.
---

---

## How it works

- **Idle detection** – When your service does not receive any incoming network requests for a defined period, DCDeploy automatically scales it down to **0 active instances**.  
- **On-demand activation** – As soon as a new request comes in, DCDeploy instantly brings up the workload, ensuring that users experience minimal cold start delay.  
- **Pay for what you use** – Since no instances are running when idle, you are not charged for compute during downtime. Only storage and minimal networking costs may apply.

---

## Benefits

- **Cost Savings** – Avoid paying for idle compute resources.  
- **Elastic Scaling** – Automatically scale back up when traffic resumes.  
- **Efficient Resource Utilization** – Free up compute capacity for active workloads.  

---

## Use cases

- **APIs with irregular traffic** – Great for services that only get requests occasionally.  
- **Development & Testing** – Save costs by running environments only when developers interact with them.  
- **Event-driven apps** – Ideal for apps that process tasks in bursts rather than continuously.

## Configuration

Enable **Scale to Zero** in your workload configuration:

```yaml
scaling:
  minInstances: 0
  maxInstances: 10
  trigger: rps
minInstances: 0 → Enables scale-to-zero.
maxInstances → Defines the maximum scaling limit.
trigger → Defines the metric used for scaling (e.g., rps = network requests per second).
```
Things to keep in mind
Cold starts may introduce slight latency for the first request after scaling from 0.

Not recommended for workloads requiring always-on availability (e.g., real-time systems).

Persistent storage and databases are not affected — only compute instances scale down.

With Scale to Zero, DCDeploy ensures your apps remain cost-efficient, responsive, and cloud-native by design.
