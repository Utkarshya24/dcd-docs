Revision events provide real-time feedback on the status of builds and deployments.  
These events are recorded against each revision and can be viewed on hover (as tooltips) or inside logs.  

---

## Build Events
These events are triggered during the build process:

- **Build failed due to internal error.**  
- **Build failed due to excessive retries.**  
- **Build failed due to timeout.**  
- **Build failed due to no build started.**  
- **Build failed due to wrong Git config.**  
- **Build failed. Please check build logs.**  
- **Build failed due to no commit hash.**  
- **Build failed. Source not fetched.**  
- **Build completed successfully.**

## Deployment Events
These events indicate the status of deployment:

- **Deployment seems stuck in progress.**  
  _(Check configured port and logs for more details.)_  

- **Deployment is successful and ready to use.**  

- **Deployment timeout.**  
  _(Check the logs for more details.)_  

- **Deployment is crashing.**  
  _(Check the logs for more details.)_  

- **Deployment startup probe failed.**  
  _(Verify configured port and logs.)_

## Event Categories
Each revision event has:
- **Message** → Human-readable status update.  
- **Status** → `active`, `failed`, or `success`.  
- **Phase** → e.g., `started`, `deployed`, `failed`.
