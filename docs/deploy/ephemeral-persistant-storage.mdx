title: Ephemeral & Persistent Storage
description: Understand the difference between ephemeral and persistent storage in DCDeploy and how to use each for your services effectively.
---

## Overview

DCDeploy supports both **ephemeral** and **persistent storage**. Choosing the right type depends on whether your service data needs to survive container restarts or deployments.  

- **Ephemeral Storage:** Temporary storage tied to the container lifecycle.  
- **Persistent Storage:** Durable storage that survives container restarts and redeployments.  

---

## Ephemeral Storage

- Created automatically with a container.  
- Data is lost when the container stops, restarts, or is deleted.  
- Best for:  
  - Temporary caches  
  - Session storage  
  - Scratch data during builds or computation  

#### Notes: 
- Use for stateless services or data that can be regenerated.
- No additional configuration needed.

## Persistent Storage
- Separate storage volume that survives container restarts or redeploys.
- Ideal for databases, uploaded files, or any critical data.

## Dashboard:

1. Navigate to the service → Volumes → Add Persistent Volume
2. Mount the volume to the desired path in the container.
3. Start the service; data persists across restarts and deployments.

#### Notes:
- Ensure volumes are backed up regularly.
- Multiple services can share volumes if configured correctly.
- Volumes can be migrated to other environments if needed.

### Comparison Table
| Feature         | Ephemeral Storage            | Persistent Storage                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Lifecycle       | Container only               | Survives restarts & redeploys            |
| Use Case        | Caches, temp files, sessions | Databases, uploaded files, critical data |
| Backup Required | No                           | Yes                                      |
| Configuration   | Automatic                    | Requires volume setup                    |


### Best Practices
- Use ephemeral storage for stateless services and temporary data.
- Use persistent storage for databases, user files, and critical data.
- Regularly backup persistent volumes.
- Avoid storing critical data on ephemeral storage.
