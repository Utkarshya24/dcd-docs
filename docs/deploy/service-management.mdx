title: Service Management
description: Manage your services in DCDeploy by starting, stopping, restarting, or deleting them. This guide covers the full lifecycle of service management for maintenance, cost optimization, and operational control.
---

## When to Manage Services

- **Maintenance** – Temporarily stop, restart, or delete services for updates or troubleshooting.  
- **Cost Optimization** – Stop or delete unused services to save resources.  
- **Testing & Configuration Changes** – Restart services to apply configuration changes without redeploying.  
- **Emergency Actions** – Stop or delete services immediately to prevent errors or security issues.

## Start, Stop & Restart Services

### How It Works

1. **Stop Service**  
   - Stops all running containers.  
   - Preserves configuration for later restart.  
   - No traffic is routed to the service while stopped.  

2. **Start Service**  
   - Starts containers using the last deployed image and configuration.  
   - Runs health checks before routing traffic.  

3. **Restart Service**  
   - Stops the service and immediately starts it again.  
   - Useful for refreshing containers without a full rebuild.  

### Dashboard Steps

1. Open the **DCDeploy dashboard**.  
2. Navigate to your service.  
3. Use the buttons:  
   - **Stop Service** to halt containers.  
   - **Start Service** to bring it online.  
   - **Restart Service** to refresh containers.  
4. Monitor logs and health checks in real-time.  

 

### Comparison Table 
| Action  | What Happens                               | Use Case                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Start   | Starts containers from last deployed image | Bring service online             |
| Stop    | Stops all containers, no traffic routed    | Maintenance, save resources      |
| Restart | Stops and starts containers immediately    | Refresh service without redeploy |

### Delete Service
#### How It Works
- Permanently removes the selected service from the environment.
- Deletes all containers, associated resources, configuration, deployment history, and logs.
- Action is irreversible, so ensure the service is no longer needed.

#### Dashboard Steps
- Open the DCDeploy dashboard.
- Navigate to the Environment tab.
- Go to the Deploy section.
- Select the service you want to delete.
- Click Mark as Delete.
- Click Continue to confirm.
- Click Deploy to finalize deletion.
- The service will be permanently removed.

### Best Practices

- Always double-check the service before stopping or deleting.
- Backup important data before deletion.
- Use staging environments for testing service management actions.
- Combine restart with zero-downtime deployment to minimize user impact.
- Automate start/stop actions during off-peak hours via scripts or CI/CD pipelines.
