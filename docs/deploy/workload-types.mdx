title: Workload Types
description: DCDeploy supports multiple workload types to match the nature of your application or service. Choosing the right workload type ensures resources are allocated efficiently and scaling policies behave as expected.

---

## Available workload types

### 1. **Service**
- Long-running processes designed to handle network traffic (HTTP, gRPC, TCP).
- Typically used for APIs, web apps, or microservices.
- Can be autoscaled based on **CPU, memory, or network RPS**.

**Example:**
```yaml
service:
  name: api-service
  image: ghcr.io/example/api:1.0.0
  port: 8080
  type: service
```

---

### 2. **Database**
- Managed databases or custom DB images you deploy.
- Persistent storage enabled.
- Optimized for durability and stateful workloads.

**Example:**
```yaml
service:
  name: postgres-db
  image: postgres:15
  port: 5432
  type: database
```
{/*
---

 ### 3. **Job**
- Short-lived processes that run to completion.
- Suitable for background tasks, migrations, data processing.
- Jobs can be scheduled, triggered manually, or run on deployment.

**Example:**
```yaml
service:
  name: data-migration
  image: ghcr.io/example/migrate:2.1.0
  type: job
  command: ["npm", "run", "migrate"]
```

---

### 4. **Cron Job**
- Recurring scheduled jobs.
- Use cron expressions for scheduling.

**Example:**
```yaml
service:
  name: nightly-report
  image: ghcr.io/example/report-gen:1.0.0
  type: cron
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"   # Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
``` 

---*/}

### 3. **Worker**
- Background consumers that process messages from a queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- No direct HTTP exposure.

**Example:**
```yaml
service:
  name: queue-worker
  image: ghcr.io/example/worker:latest
  type: worker
```

## Choosing the right workload type

| Workload Type | Use Case |
|---------------|----------|
| **Service**   | Web apps, APIs, microservices |
| **Database**  | Stateful data storage |
| **Worker**    | Background queue/message processing |

{/* | **Job**       | One-off or batch processes |
| **Cron Job**  | Recurring scheduled tasks | */}
---

## Best practices
- Use **Services** for stateless traffic-handling apps.
- Run **Databases** only when you need custom DB setups (prefer managed DBs if available).
{/* - For **Jobs/Cron Jobs**, keep them lightweight and idempotent. */}
- Ensure **Workers** have retry logic and error handling.
