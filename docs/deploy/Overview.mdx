The **Organization Overview** page gives you a central view of your organizationâ€™s resources, usage, and billing in dcdeploy.  
It helps you monitor environments, manage balance, and track activities across workloads in real time.

## Sections in Organization Overview

### 1. **Environments**
- Lists all active environments under the organization (e.g., `env1`, `public-repo`, `private-repo`, `db`).  
- For each environment you can:
  - View associated workloads and machines.
  - Manage deployments.
  - Access environment-specific settings.  

ðŸ‘‰ Use the **View** button to drill into details for each environment.

  - `public-repo` â€“ â‚¹9,381.05  
  - `private-repo` â€“ â‚¹141.97  
  - `db` â€“ minor usage

## Key Use Cases

- Quickly monitor environment health and usage.  
- Identify high-cost environments and optimize workloads.  
- Track build and deployment history for debugging.  
- Manage balance to avoid service interruptions.

## Best Practices

- Regularly check the **Activity Timeline** to spot failed builds.  
- Use **Usage by Environments** to optimize cost allocation.  
- Ensure your **balance is positive** to prevent deployment failures.  
- Organize workloads into separate environments for clarity (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
