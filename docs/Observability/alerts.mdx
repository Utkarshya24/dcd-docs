DCDeploy provides a powerful alerting system to keep you informed about critical events, resource usage, and system changes.  
Alerts help you **track service health, deployment issues, user activities, billing events, and feature updates**—all in real-time.

---

## Types of Alerts

Below are the categories of alerts you may receive:

### Success Alerts
- **Service Build Completed Successfully** → Service built and ready for deployment.  
- **Service Deployment Completed Successfully** → Service deployed and running.  
- **Database Created Successfully** → Database provisioned and available.  
- **Backup Completed** → Backup completed successfully.  

---

### Failure Alerts
- **Service Build Failed** → Build error occurred, check logs.  
- **Service Deployment Failed** → Deployment error occurred.  
- **Database Creation Failed** → Database provisioning failed.  
- **Backup Failed** → Backup did not complete successfully.  
- **Service Crashed** → Service stopped unexpectedly.  

---

### Warnings
- **Container Health Issue** → Container is unhealthy, check logs.  
- **Subscription Expiry Warning** → Subscription is about to expire, renew to avoid downtime.  
- **High Resource Usage** → Usage thresholds exceeded. Examples:  
  - High CPU Usage  
  - High Memory Usage  
  - High Disk Usage (Persistent / Ephemeral)  
  - High Network Input / Output Usage  

---

### Informational
- **User Role Changed** → A user’s role was updated in your environment.  
- **New User Joined** → A new user joined your organization.  
- **New Feature Released** → A feature has been rolled out to your environment.  

---

### Billing & Subscription
- **Payment Failed** → Payment for your subscription failed.  
- **Subscription Expiry Warning** → Your subscription is nearing expiry.  

---

## Usage Alerts

DCDeploy generates **open** and **close** usage alerts automatically when resource consumption crosses defined thresholds:

- **Open Alert** → Raised when usage (CPU, Memory, Disk, or Network) exceeds safe limits.  
- **Close Alert** → Triggered when usage returns back to normal.  

Example:  
- **High CPU Usage Open Alert** → Service exceeded CPU threshold.  
- **High CPU Usage Alert Closed** → CPU usage returned to safe levels.

## Activity Log Mapping

Some alerts are mapped directly to activity logs for traceability:

| Activity Log Key            | Alert Type                     |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `service-deploy-success`   | Service Deployment Success      |
| `service-deploy-failed`    | Service Deployment Failed       |
| `service-build-success`    | Service Build Success           |
| `service-build-failed`     | Service Build Failed            |
