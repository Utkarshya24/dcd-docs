title: Metrics
---
The **Metrics** tab helps you monitor workload performance in real time.  
You can track CPU, Memory, Network, Storage usage, and response errors over a selected time window.

---

## CPU Usage

Tracks how much CPU your workload is consuming over time.  
Helps you identify performance spikes or bottlenecks.
