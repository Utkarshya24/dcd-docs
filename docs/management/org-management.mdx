## Best Practices
- Use separate organizations for **production** and **staging** projects.  
- Assign **Owner** roles carefully; only trusted team members should manage billing.  
- Regularly review user access to maintain security.  
- Monitor usage under **Settings → Usage and Billing** to avoid unexpected costs.
