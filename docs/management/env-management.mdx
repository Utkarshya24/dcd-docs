title: Environment Management
description: Manage your environments in dcdeploy including rename, clone, and delete operations.
---

Environments in dcdeploy represent isolated spaces for your workloads (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`).  
They allow you to test, deploy, and manage applications separately.

---

## Rename an Environment
You can rename an environment to better reflect its purpose.

1. Navigate to **Environment → Settings**.  
2. Update the **Environment Name** field.  
3. Click **Save**.  

> ⚠️ Renaming does not affect workloads, secrets, or configurations linked to the environment.

---

## Clone an Environment
Easily duplicate an existing environment to create a copy with the same configurations.

1. Go to **Environment → Settings**.  
2. Select **Clone Environment**.  
3. Provide a new name for the cloned environment.  
4. Click **Clone**.  

The cloned environment includes:
- Workloads and configurations  
- Secrets and variables  
- Networking settings  

> ⚠️ Billing and usage are tracked separately for cloned environments.

---

## Delete an Environment
Environments can be permanently deleted when no longer needed.

1. Navigate to **Environment → Settings**.  
2. Scroll to **Delete Environment**.  
3. Confirm by clicking **Delete**.  

> ⚠️ This action is irreversible. All workloads, secrets, and associated billing data will be removed.

## Best Practices
- Use **cloning** to quickly set up staging from production.  
- Keep environment names descriptive (`dev2`, `staging`, `prod`).  
- Always review secrets before cloning to avoid leaking sensitive data.  
- Delete unused environments to optimize costs.
