title: Overview
description: Learn what DCDeploy is, the problems it solves, and the key features that make it a secure, high-performance platform for running modern applications.
---

DCDeploy is a **developer-first deployment platform** designed to run modern applications on **high-performance bare metal infrastructure** with built-in security, networking, and scalability.  

It removes the complexity of managing servers, Kubernetes, networking, and security, so you can focus on building applications—not infrastructure.

##  Why DCDeploy?

- **Simple** – Deploy apps and databases in minutes without complex setup.  
- **Secure** – End-to-end encryption, internal networking, private services, and DDoS protection.  
- **High Performance** – Runs workloads on **Intel & AMD bare metal** machines with no in-between virtualization overhead.  
- **Scalable** – Auto-scaling, microVMs, namespaces, and per-env isolation ensure your apps grow seamlessly.

## Core Features

### 1. **Environments & Namespaces**
- Isolated environments for **dev, staging, prod**.  
- Each environment has its own **private network**.  

### 2. **Private Services & Databases**
- Databases and internal services run **without public exposure**.  
- Accessible only via **internal links** within a env.  

### 3. **Networking & Security**
- **Private networks** per env.  
- **TCP Proxy with SSL** for secure DB access from outside.  
- **Cloudflare DDoS protection** & **default request rate limits**.  
- **SSL certificates** managed automatically.  

### 4. **Security by Design**
- Built with **Cilium, Kata Containers, encryption at rest, and secrets isolation**.  
- **Audit logs** track every action and API call for compliance.  

### 5. **Scalable Infrastructure**
- Powered by **bare metal + microVMs (Firecracker, Cloud Hypervisor)**.  
- Ephemeral & persistent storage options for workloads.  
- Optimized for **high-bandwidth networking**.  

### 6. **Developer Experience**
- Git-based deployments.  
- Simple **service management** (start, stop, restart, delete).  
- Easy environment cloning.  
- Role-based access & permissions.

## Security Highlights

- **CF DDoS protection** – all traffic is protected by Cloudflare’s global network.  
- **Default request rate limits** – prevent abuse by throttling excessive requests.  
- **Audit logs** – every action is tracked for visibility.  
- **Secrets management** – sensitive data is never exposed.

## Summary

DCDeploy is more than just hosting—it’s a **secure, high-performance platform** that takes care of the hard parts of running applications:  
- **Security** by default  
- **Networking** simplified  
- **Scalability** built-in  
- **Developer-friendly** workflows  

So you can ship apps **faster, safer, and at scale**
