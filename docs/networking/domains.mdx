description: Configure default `.cloud` subdomains or connect custom domains for your applications.
---

Each application deployed on dcdeploy gets a **default `.cloud` subdomain**.  
You can also connect your own **custom domains** for production-grade deployments.

---

## Default `.cloud` Domains
- Automatically generated when you deploy.  
- Useful for quick testing or preview environments.  
- Example: `myapp.dcdeploy.cloud`.

---

## Custom Domains
You can bind your own domains for branding and production use.

### Steps:
1. Go to **workload-tab**.  
2. Click on view **Quick Action** button of the service you want to add custom-domain
3. In workload-modal navigate to settings-Tab
4. Add your custom domain (e.g., `app.example.com`).  
5. Update DNS records to point to dcdeploy’s edge network:
   ```txt
   CNAME  app.example.com → myapp.dcdeploy.cloud
6. Wait for DNS propagation.
SSL certificates are provisioned automatically.

## Best Practices
- Use default .cloud domains for staging or temporary previews.
- Always secure production apps with a custom domain + SSL.
- Regularly review DNS settings after domain registrar changes.
