title: Outbound Bandwidth
description: 1TB of free outbound data transfer per organization each month.
---

Every DCDeploy organization gets **1TB of outbound data transfer free per month**.  
This applies to all workloads, environments, and domains combined.

---

## Details
- Inbound traffic is always **free**.  
- Outbound traffic beyond 1TB is billed per GB.  
- Usage is aggregated across all environments in your organization.  

---

## Example

| Plan                | Included Outbound | Additional Cost |
|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Default (per org)   | 1TB               | $0.10 / GB      |

---

## Monitoring Usage
1. Navigate to **Org â†’ Metrics**.  
2. Check **Outbound Bandwidth** usage.  
3. Set alerts for thresholds (e.g., 80% usage).  

---

## Best Practices
- Use caching and CDNs to reduce outbound usage.  
- Compress assets and enable gzip/brotli.  
- Place databases in the same region as workloads to avoid unnecessary data egress.
