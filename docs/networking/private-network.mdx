title: Private Network
description: Securely connect environments and workloads over dcdeploy’s private network.
---

dcdeploy provides an **isolated private network** for all workloads inside your environments.  
This enables secure communication between services without exposing them to the public internet.

---

## Key Features
- **Environment-wide isolation** — workloads in the same environment can talk to each other privately.  
- **Cross-environment networking** — connect services across multiple environments if enabled.  
- **Automatic DNS resolution** — workloads are discoverable by name.  

---

## Use Cases
- Secure backend-to-database connections.  
- Microservices communication without public exposure.  
- Hybrid setups where only specific endpoints are public.  

---

## Example

```yaml
# workload.yaml
services:
  api:
    ports:
      - 8080
    network: private
  db:
    image: postgres:16
    network: private
```    
## Best Practices
- Keep databases and internal services private.
- Only expose workloads via proxy or edge if necessary.
- Use secrets for credentials even in private networks.
