title: Edge Network
description: Deliver apps globally using Cloudflare’s edge network for performance and DDoS protection.
---

DCDeploy applications are delivered via **Cloudflare’s global edge network**.  
This provides low-latency access, DDoS mitigation, and TLS termination by default.

---

## Benefits
- **Global CDN caching** for faster delivery.  
- **Automatic TLS/SSL** certificates.  
- **DDoS protection** at the network edge.  
- **Anycast routing** for reliability.  

---

## Use Cases
- Deploying production web apps.  
- Handling traffic spikes safely.  
- Reducing latency for global users.  

---

## Example

When you bind a custom domain:
```txt
CNAME → myapp.DCDeploy.cloud
Traffic is automatically routed via Cloudflare’s edge.
```

##  Best Practices
- Keep your app stateless for maximum caching.
- Use persistent volumes or managed databases for state.
- Monitor metrics to optimize global performance.
