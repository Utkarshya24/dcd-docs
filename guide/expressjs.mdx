This guide walks you through deploying an Express.js application on DCDeploy, including setup, build configuration, and best practices.

---

## Quick Start: Hello World

You can try deploying a minimal Express.js app to test the workflow.

1. Create a new project:
   ```bash
   mkdir hello-dcdeploy
   cd hello-dcdeploy
   npm init -y
   npm install express
   ```
2. Create an index.js file with the following code:
```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello DCDeploy ðŸš€ from Express.js!");
});

app.listen(PORT, "0.0.0.0", () => {
  console.log(`Server running on http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}`);
});
```
3. Update package.json scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  }
}
```
4. Run locally:

```bash
npm start
```
5. Commit and push to GitHub/Git provider.
6. Deploy on DCDeploy using the steps in the guide below.

## Overview
Express.js is a lightweight Node.js web framework often used for REST APIs and backend services.
On DCDeploy, you can deploy Express.js apps using:
- Build from Code (auto-detected Node.js project) â€“ easiest method.
- Custom Dockerfile â€“ for advanced control over runtime and dependencies.

## Prerequisites
- Express.js project (index.js or app.js entrypoint).
- package.json with a valid start script.
- GitHub (or Git) repository to push your project.
- (Optional) Dockerfile if you want a custom build.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. Prepare Your Express App
- Ensure package.json has a start script that runs your server.
- App must listen on 0.0.0.0 and use the PORT environment variable.

2. Add Dockerfile (optional)
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
3. Push Code to Git
- Initialize Git, commit files, and push to your Git provider.
- Add .dockerignore if using Docker.

4. Deploy on DCDeploy
- In DCDeploy dashboard â†’ Deploy tab of your environment.
- Create a new service â†’ select Build from Code or Docker Registry.
- Provide repo + branch.
- Set port to 3000 (or the one used in your app).
- Configure environment variables for secrets, DB URLs, etc.
- Choose machine type (CPU, RAM) based on traffic needs.
- Deploy and monitor logs.

## Example Service Config
```yaml
services:
  express-app:
    build:
      context: ./
      dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
      repo: your-username/express-app
      ref: main
      refType: branch
      autoBuild: true
    ports:
      - 3000
    protocol: https
    minScale: 1
    maxScale: 2
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
      API_KEY: your-secret-key
```      

## Best Practices
- Use environment variables (not hardcoded secrets).
- Use internal networking in DCDeploy to connect databases/APIs securely.
- Add health check endpoints (e.g. /healthz).
- Log errors clearly for debugging.
- Scale services with minScale/maxScale depending on workload.

## Troubleshooting
| Problem                  | Likely Cause                                 | Solution                                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| App crashes on deploy    | Wrong entrypoint or missing dependencies     | Check `start` script, install deps.           |
| Not accessible           | App not listening on `0.0.0.0` or wrong port | Ensure `listen("0.0.0.0", process.env.PORT)`. |
| Build timeout / too slow | Large deps or missing Docker ignore          | Optimize deps, use `.dockerignore`.           |
| Env vars not working     | Missing DCDeploy config                      | Add env vars in dashboard.                    |
