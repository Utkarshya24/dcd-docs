DCDeploy natively supports **Docker deployments**.  
You can bring your own **Dockerfile** or deploy directly from a **Docker image** hosted in a registry.

---

## When to Use Docker on DCDeploy
- You want **full control** over runtime, dependencies, and OS libraries.  
- Youâ€™re deploying apps not natively supported by a language/framework guide.  
- You already maintain **Docker images** in registries like DockerHub, GitHub Container Registry, or AWS ECR.  
- You need **multi-service setups** with custom networking.

## Deployment Options

| Method             | Use Case                                                |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dockerfile**     | Build from your source code on DCDeploy. Best for CI/CD pipelines. |
| **Docker Image**   | Deploy prebuilt images from a container registry. Fast and portable. |

## Example: Using a Dockerfile

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in your project:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:18-alpine
   WORKDIR /app
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install --production
   COPY . .
   EXPOSE 3000
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
